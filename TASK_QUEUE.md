# ExpertMatch Task Queue
Last updated: May 2026

## NOW (blocking or broken)
- [x] Auth overhaul: firm-based seats, invite-only flow, remove master password
      — firmStore.ts, set-password flow, admin panel rebuilt (May 2026)
- [x] Navigation flow: middleware redirects / and /login → /app for authenticated users
- [x] Landing page nav: "Open ExpertMatch" (gold) + Welcome [Name] + Sign Out when signed in
- [x] Post-login redirect: always lands on /app (login page default)
- [x] Welcome name: firstName stored on UserRecord, included in session payload,
      NavBar uses it when present — falls back to email-derived name
- [x] Onboarding flow: /onboarding stepper (calendar → billing → profile),
      middleware gates incomplete users, session refreshed with onboardingComplete:true
      NOTE: calendar (OAuth) and billing (Stripe) steps are stubs — see TODOs in route files
